Get-Method Validation:-

[Assert the Status]
Assert.assertEquals(getresponse.getStatusCode(), 200);

[Print the status code]
System.out.println(getresponse.getStatusCode());

[Fetch the All header Values]
System.out.println(getresponse.getHeaders());

[Fetch the specific header Value]
System.out.println(getresponse.getHeader("Content-Type")); 

[Assert the Specific Header Values]
Assert.assertEquals(getresponse.getHeader("Content-Type"), "application/json; charset=utf-8");

I have verified date: Date=Fri, 22 Nov 2024 12:35:59 GMT


[Fetch body content of Response]
System.out.println(getresponse.asPrettyString()); 

[This is for true or falls, like we have passed the value it's part of the response or not it just verified.]
Assert.assertTrue(getresponse.asString().contains("true")); 

[Validate body Content using Json Path.]
Assert.assertEquals(getresponse.jsonPath().getString("data.middle_name"),"Cali" ); 

Post-Method:-

I have created one TC's by using the Eclipse.
Then I will have to write our code in a method like add new Student Data And because this method we are going to take it as a as a test case.
So we will use annotation, which is test. Now my test case is ready. we have a API and it shows method is post means
this api can be used to make a post request means this API is going to be used to add new resource to the server.
I'm creating a variable here String and post end point. We can give any name to this variable. So we have set our endpoint which we are going to use later on.
We need to pass as a request. This Request Content is a prerequisite means whenever we are making a post request as a prerequisite, 
this content should be set in the request itself.
we have to define header, which is what kind of input you are sending. So it's a Application/Json.
In the case of post, we cannot make a post request directly. First of all, we have to set our body means request body. We have to set our headers.
First of all, we will have to call a method with the name given, given means. 
First I'm setting a prerequisite, so if you check it, it gives the response, which is request specifications. means you can specify your different parts of the request.
It could be header, it could be body. So first of all, we have to call this given method.
It will give us request specification object and I am giving the name Post Request.
First, we are saying rest assured, given means.First we are setting the prerequisite given means prerequisite.
Then I am just using the PostRequest object here, we have a method with the name body here in the body we can define the complete body as a string.
We can apply a pojo, which is a design pattern Pojo.
We have to set header as well, if we are not setting header value it's fail and we will receive 415 status code.
The header is Content-Type, "Application/json".
