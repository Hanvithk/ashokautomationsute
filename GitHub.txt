ðŸ”¹ What is GitHub? (Extended Explanation)
GitHub is a cloud-based platform built on top of Git, a version control system. 
It helps individuals and teams manage code changes and collaborate on development projects.

Think of GitHub like Google Drive for code â€“ but much more powerful.

ðŸ“Œ Common Git Commands:
Command	        Description
git init	Initialize a new Git repository
git clone	Copy an existing repository from GitHub
git add	        Stage changes to be committed
git commit	Save staged changes with a message
git push	Upload local commits to GitHub
git pull	Download latest changes from GitHub
git branch	Manage branches
git merge	Merge one branch into another

ðŸ”¹ What is a Commit in Git/GitHub?
A commit is a record of what changes you made to files. It's like saying:

"Here is what I changed, and why."

Each commit includes:

A commit message: describing the change.

A unique ID (SHA): to identify the commit.

The author: who made the change.

A timestamp: when it happened.

âœ… Commit Workflow Example:
bash
Copy
Edit
git init                         # Initialize git in your project
git add .                        # Stage all files for commit
git commit -m "Add login test case"   # Commit with a message
git push origin main             # Push the code to GitHub
ðŸ”¹ Example Use Case for Automation Tester (You!):
Letâ€™s say you're working on a Selenium project:

You write a new test case LoginTest.java.

You commit your code:

bash
Copy
Edit
git add LoginTest.java
git commit -m "Added login test case with valid credentials"
You push the code to GitHub:

bash
Copy
Edit
git push origin main
This helps you:

Keep track of test changes.

Share your work with the team or interviewers.

Fix bugs without losing original code.

ðŸ”¹ GitHub Interview Tips for Testers:
Question	Tip for Answer
Do you use Git or GitHub?	Yes, I use Git for version control and GitHub to collaborate with my team and store automation scripts.
What is a commit?	A snapshot of changes in the code with a message, helps in tracking changes.
How do you handle multiple testers working on one project?	We use branches and pull requests to manage and review code collaboratively.
Do you push code to GitHub?	Yes, I push my test cases and framework updates to GitHub for version control and sharing.

 How to Say in an Interview:
"I use Git to manage my test automation code. For example, when I create new test cases, I work on a separate branch, commit my changes with meaningful messages, and push them to GitHub. Once reviewed, I merge them back to the main branch through a pull request. This ensures clean collaboration and version tracking in a team setup."
